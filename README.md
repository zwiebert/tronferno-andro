# tronferno-andro
Experimental Android GUI for [tronferno-mcu](https://github.com/zwiebert/tronferno-mcu)

This is work in progress.  Its not fully implemented yet and I did not waste too much time on the GUI design.


### What it can do already

* open and close shutters  (mcu command send)
* change the built-in timers (mcu command timer)
* show the current timers for each shutter (mcu timer option rs=2)
* scan the ID of the original 2411 (mcu config option cu=auto)

### Things to add or change 

* allow using motor IDs (e.g. for adding a motor to a group)
* ...
